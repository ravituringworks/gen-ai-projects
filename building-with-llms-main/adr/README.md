## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

```markdown
# ADR {number}: {title}

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```
