# Production-Ready Multi‑Agent Market Intelligence System — Specification (v1.0)

> **Goal**: A compliant, high‑performance, multi‑agent platform for market intelligence, forecasting, and portfolio decision support with rigorous backtesting, live monitoring, and enterprise governance.

---

## 1. Scope & Objectives

### 1.1 Primary Capabilities
- Multi‑agent research and analysis across equities (NASDAQ & OTC) and optional asset classes.
- Near‑real‑time signal generation (intraday) and EOD analytics (daily) with explainability.
- Portfolio construction and risk overlays with live & simulated execution pathways.
- Institutional‑grade compliance, auditability, and model governance (SEC/FINRA/MiFID II aligned).
- Comprehensive backtesting with walk‑forward, transaction‑cost modeling, and stress tests.

### 1.2 Out of Scope (v1)
- Direct discretionary trading or automated order routing to live brokers (support via adapters/simulation; live execution can be gated behind compliance controls in v1.1+).
- Exotic asset‑class peculiarities (e.g., on‑chain derivatives) beyond pluggable adapters.

### 1.3 Key Non‑Functional Goals
- **Latency**: sub‑second for streaming ingestion → features; <200ms cache lookups; <2s for insight rendering.
- **Throughput**: ≥100K msgs/min ingestion; scalable to 10M ticks/day.
- **Reliability**: SLO ≥ 99.9%; RPO ≤ 5 min; RTO ≤ 15 min.
- **Security**: Zero‑trust posture, least‑privilege, encrypted at rest/in transit, SBOM & signed images.
- **Portability**: OCI images, **Podman** native; Kube‑compatible manifests.
